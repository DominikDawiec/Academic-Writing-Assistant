# Academic Writing Assistant

In January 2024, I conducted a workshop on Introduction to **Generative AI (GenAI)** at the University of Economics in Krakow for the Data Analysis Scientific Club (KNAD). 
This workshop featured the development of a specialized code designed to enhance the **processing, chunking, and embedding of extensive textual materials**, such as books. 
This code effectively integrates these materials into a **vector database**. 
Additionally, the project includes a Streamlit application, which leverages the vector database to search for and retrieve the most pertinent information chunks in response to specific queries. 
**The application not only delivers accurate answers based on these information chunks but also cites the source material used**. 
This system is particularly beneficial for facilitating research and aiding in the composition of theoretical chapters, significantly improving the efficiency and comprehensiveness of scholarly and research work.
